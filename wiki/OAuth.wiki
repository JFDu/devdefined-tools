#summary DevDefined.OAuth - an OAuth consumer and provider implementation for .Net
#labels OAuth

= Introduction =

After looking at a few OAuth examples for .Net I was disheartened by their limited implementations, and especially a lack of a good provider implementation.  

I started !DevDefined.OAuth originally to accompany my REST presentation for the local .Net user group in May - but have decided to continue it's development for a little while, in a hope that it might prove useful to others trying to implementing OAuth for .Net (and because I need it for an upcoming project).

For more information on OAuth itself check out http://www.oauth.net/ and http://wiki.oauth.net/ or the google group at: http://groups.google.com/group/oauth/
