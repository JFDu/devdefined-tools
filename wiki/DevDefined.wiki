= Projects =

  * [Common] - Common code used in DevDefined projects and to accompany random blog posts.
  * [OAuth] - An OAuth library for .Net - both consumer and provider implementations.
  * [MvpWinforms] - A Winforms MVP framework targeting the .Net Framework 2.0 and taking advantage of the excellent Castle Windsor IoC container.
  * [NUnitIronPythonAddin] - Add-ins to allow testing of IronPython code within compiled .Net assemblies - generally this is useful when writing applications that leverage IronPython for scripting, and you want to include tests for consumption of your IronPython API (at least that's what I use it for).  There are versions for NUnit 2.2 and 2.4.
