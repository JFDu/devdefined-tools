17th November 2008
------------------

Added WCF code and example channel from Pablo Cibraro (http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/).
Organised code into 2 solution folders - core implementation - and examples.
Added changes file to track overall logical changes.
Moved MIT license into code region, so it'll collapse.
Signed the WCF and OAuth assemblies.
